//     Command: PRIVMSG
//    Parameters: <msgtarget> <text to be sent>

//    PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users, as well as to
//    send messages to channels.  <msgtarget> is usually the nickname of
//    the recipient of the message, or a channel name.

//    The <msgtarget> parameter may also be a host mask (#<mask>) or server
//    mask ($<mask>).  In both cases the server will only send the PRIVMSG
//    to those who have a server or host matching the mask.  The mask MUST
//    have at least 1 (one) "." in it and no wildcards following the last
//    ".".  This requirement exists to prevent people sending messages to
//    "#*" or "$*", which would broadcast to all users.  Wildcards are the
//    '*' and '?'  characters.  This extension to the PRIVMSG command is
//    only available to operators.
