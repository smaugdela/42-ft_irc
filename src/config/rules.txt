Rules of the configuration file :

    * All the variables must be declared (see file.config).
    * Ping Should not be less than 10 seconds.
    * Timeout is in milliseconds (Cannot be 0 ms, put to -1 if you don't want any timeout).
    * All the variables values should not contain spaces
    *

If any of these rules is missing, the configuration file is considered incomplete
