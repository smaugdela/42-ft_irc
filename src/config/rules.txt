 
Rules of the configuration file :
 
	* All the variables must be declared (see file.config).
	* 'motd' and 'info' variables are the paths to the motd and info files.
	* Variables should not contain any spaces.
	* Ping Should not be less than 10 seconds.
	* Timeout is in milliseconds (Cannot be 0 ms, put to -1 if you don't want any timeout).
	* Max backlogs should not be higher than the one indicated for your device (can probably be found in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog).
 
If any of these rules is missing, the configuration file is considered incomplete.
