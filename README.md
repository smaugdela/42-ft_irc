## TODO
- Revise well the (full prefix) initialisation of host.
- Debug privmsg by reformating Channel::broadcast() (probably need to extract the send() part of the Client::send_to() method, and use it with a different way to build prefixes specifically for channels).
- Check leaks.

Whoever reads this, have a good day!
