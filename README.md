## TODO
- Check how to do the full prefix (nick!name@host) and if it is compatible with channel brodacast(), server brodcast() AND Client::send_to().
- Check how other projects tackle the IP address of hostname (especially how it detects localhost).
- Implement channels.
- join.
- privmsg.
- Check leaks.

Whoever reads this, have a good day!
