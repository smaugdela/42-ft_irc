## TODO
- Is serv_send() really to be used in that way (send a buffered list of message, resulting from the execution of the commands of the clients)? Or maybe should we send each time a command needs to send, provided that the client is writeable?
- Check leaks
- Implement the execution of messages
- Implement channels

Whoever reads this, have a good day!
